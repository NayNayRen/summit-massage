                area, theraputic massage practice that handles, and accepts, all
                forms of muscular discomfort. Whether aches and pains are what

              <li>
                Summit Massage was established in early 2013 by our owner and
                lead therapist Dr. Seus Magoose. Dr. Seus is flanked by his two
                massage therapists, DR. Jekyl and Dr. Hyde. Summit has been
                helping those in need in the Clearwater area with over 35 years
                of combined theraputic service.

              <h3>Deep Tissue</h3>
              <div class="overlay">
                <p>
                  Deep tissue massage therapy is similar to Swedish massage, but
                  the deeper pressure is beneficial in releasing chronic muscle
                  tension. Sometimes this technique involves the therapist using
                  firmer pressure to reach these key areas and get them to
                  release, recommended for people who are comfortable with a
                  slightly more intense touch.

              <h3>Hot Stone</h3>
              <div class="overlay">
                <p>
                  Each 1 hour hot stone massage therapy session promotes deeper
                  muscle relaxation through the placement of smooth,
                  water-heated stones at key points on the body. Our
                  professional massage therapists also incorporate a customized
                  massage, with the use of hot stones which offers enhanced
                  benefits.

                <p>
                  Aromatherapy uses plant materials and aromatic plant oils,
                  including essential oils, and other aroma compounds for
                  improving psychological or physical well-being. It can be
                  offered as a complementary therapy or as a form of alternative
                  medicine.

              <h3>Shiatsu Massage</h3>
              <div class="overlay">
                <p>
                  Shiatsu Massage is an alternative technique that involves
                  manual pressure applied to specific points on the body in an
                  attempt to relieve tension and pain. In the Japanese language,
                  shiatsu means "finger pressure". Shiatsu techniques include
                  massages with fingers, thumbs, feet and palms.

            <ul class="black_background_2">
              <li class="teal_text">Reduced Pain and Stiffness</li>
              <li>
                Massage helps people spend more time in deep sleep, the
                restorative stage in which your body barely moves.
              </li>
              <li class="teal_text">Reduced Inflammation and Swelling</li>
              <li>
                Massage supplements standard injury rehabilitation procedures,
                helps the body pump more oxygen and nutrients into tissue and
                vital organs, and accelerates the rehabilitation process.
              </li>
              <li class="teal_text">Stress Management</li>
              <li>
                Massage therapy lowers cortisol, a hormone that’s produced in
                response to stress, by an average of 31 percent. And when
                cortisol levels decline, serotonin (contributor to feelings of
                well-being and happiness) levels increase. Research has shown
                serotonin levels to increase on average 28 percent after massage
                therapy.
              </li>
              <li class="teal_text">Better Sleep</li>
              <li>
                If you’ve ever dozed off on a massage table, you don’t need to
                be convinced that a massage can promote healthy sleep. It has
                also been said that one hour of effective massage can be equal
                to 4 hours of rest.
              </li>
              <li class="teal_text">Increased Flexibility</li>
              <li>
                By working on muscles, connective tissues, tendons, ligaments,
                and joints, regular massage can improve your flexibility and
                range of motion, keeping your joints more fluid and making them
                less injury prone.
