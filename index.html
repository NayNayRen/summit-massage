          <li class="teal_text black_background_2">Who We Are...</li>
          <li>Summit Massage is a Clearwater, Florida, homegrown from the area, theraputic massage
          practice that handles, and accepts, all forms of muscular discomfort. Whether aches and
          pains are what plague you, stress from the every day work/life cycle, or just needing that
          bit of relaxation worked in, our team at Summit can assist with all of the above.
          </li>
          <li class="teal_text black_background_2">Our History...</li>

          Magoose. Dr. Seus is flanked by his two massage therapists, DR. Jekyl and Dr. Hyde. Summit
          has been helping those in need in the Clearwater area with over 35 years of combined
          theraputic service.</li>
          <li class="teal_text black_background_2">Our Promise...</li>

      <h2>Our Therapies</h2>
      <div class="therapy_container_1">
        <div class="deep_box">
          <h3>Deep Tissue</h3>
          <div class="overlay">
          <p class="black_background">Deep tissue massage therapy is similar to Swedish massage, but
          the deeper pressure is beneficial in releasing chronic muscle tension. The focus is on the
          deepest layers of muscle tissue, tendons, and fascia. Sometimes this technique involves the
          therapist using firmer pressure to reach these key areas and get them to release, which is
          why this particular massage is often recommended for people who are comfortable with a
          slightly more intense touch.</p>
        </div>
        </div>
        <div class="stone_box">
          <h3>Hot Stone</h3>
          <p class="black_background_2">Each 1 hour hot stone massage therapy session promotes deeper
          muscle relaxation through the placement of smooth, water-heated stones at key points on the
          body. Our professional massage therapists also incorporate a customized massage, with the use
          of hot stones which offers enhanced benefits.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="therapy_container_2">
        <div class="aroma_box">
          <h3>Aromatherapy</h3>
          <p class="black_background_2">Aromatherapy uses plant materials and aromatic plant oils, including
          essential oils, and other aroma compounds for improving psychological or physical well-being.
          It can be offered as a complementary therapy or as a form of alternative medicine.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="shiatsu_box">
          <h3>Shiatsu</h3>
          <div class="overlay">
          <p class="black_background">Shiatsu Massage is an alternative technique that involves manual
          pressure applied to specific points on the body in an attempt to relieve tension and pain.
          In the Japanese language, shiatsu means "finger pressure". Shiatsu techniques include massages
          with fingers, thumbs, feet and palms; assisted stretching; and joint manipulation and
          mobilization.</p>

      <h2>Health Benefits</h2>

          <div>
            <ul>
              <li class="teal_text black_background_2">Reduced Pain and Stiffness</li>
              <li>Massage helps people spend more time in deep sleep, the restorative stage in which your
              body barely moves.</li>
              <li class="teal_text black_background_2">Reduced Inflammation and Swelling</li>
              <li>Massage supplements standard injury rehabilitation procedures, helps the body pump more
              oxygen and nutrients into tissue and vital organs, and accelerates the rehabilitation process.</li>
              <li class="teal_text black_background_2">Stress Management</li>
              <li>Massage therapy lowers cortisol, a hormone that’s produced in response to stress, by an
              average of 31 percent. And when cortisol levels decline, serotonin (contributor to feelings of
              well-being and happiness) levels increase. Research has shown serotonin levels to increase on
              average 28 percent after massage therapy.</li>
              <li class="teal_text black_background_2">Better Sleep</li>
              <li>If you’ve ever dozed off on a massage table, you don’t need to be convinced that a massage
              can promote healthy sleep. It has also been said that one hour of effective massage can be equal
              to 4 hours of rest.</li>
              <li class="teal_text black_background_2">Increased Flexibility</li>
              <li>By working on muscles, connective tissues, tendons, ligaments, and joints, regular massage
              can improve your flexibility and range of motion, keeping your joints more fluid and making them
              less injury prone.</li>
